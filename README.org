A repository of machine learning notes and python scripts, scripts which demonstrate PyTorch in simple scenarios. Each section starts with a simple outline of the learning  method, then a discussion on the provided python scripts. The scripts increasingly integrate PyTorch's library.

GitHub does not render my equations very well.  For a better experience, view the web version of this README:  [[https://raw.githack.com/JohnNehls/PyTorchExamples/main/README.html][LINK HERE]].
* Linear Regression
The ubiquitous linear regression is deployed when we can stomach the assumption that the relationship between the features and the target is approximately linear and the noise is "well-behaved" which I believe means it follows a normal distribution.

Minimizing the mean squared error is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of a
linear model under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise. [D2L 3.1.3]

** Prediction equation
Linear Regression is used to predict a numerical value, $\hat{y}$, from observations, $X = \{x_1, x_2, \cdots,  x_{n}\}$ with the equation  $$\hat{y}(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i f_i (X)$$  where the linear name (in linear regression)  comes from the fact that the equation is linear w.r.t. the weights, $w_i$.

The combination of function and data point $f_i (X)$ is called a *feature*. Features make up the /basis/ for the regression, thus should be unique. *The features are up to us; we most only keep the prediction equation linear  w.r.t. the weights.*
*** Examples
W can have linear combination of the observations,
  $$\hat{y} = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3$$
or a linear combination of polynomials on one data point,
  $$\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3$$,
even a linear combination of special functions with mixed kernel data points,  $$\hat{y} = w_0 \left( x_0 +x_3 \right) + w_1 arcsin(x_0) + tanh(x_1^2) + w_3 x_0^5$$.
*** Choosing the features
 In the linear regression paradigm, the features are chosen  before the optimization. Thus, the guidance is to  investigation the data and try to find important features. how to do this is beyond the scope of the notes. /footnote:/ In deep learning the features are also learned int he optimization process.

*** Canonical formulation
The way this prediction equation is usually expressed is that each $x$ is a feature, and the prediction equation can be expressed with linear algebra,
$$\begin{align}
\hat{y}(X) &=& w_0\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i  \\
                  &=& w_0 + \textbf{w}^T \textbf{x} \\
                  &=& \textbf{X} \textbf{w} + w_0
\end{align}$$,
which clearly shows the linear algebra under the hood ad the expense of leaving out the idea of how the features are formed.

I chose to present it as I did above as it more clearly shows, given a set of data, what we are able to do to come up with an effective model; namely, combine and transform the measurements as we wish.

Regardless of preference, the following material is agnostic to the expression of the prediction equation.

**** including combinations of features
There is also a canonical formulation including the set of features $$\psi_{i,j} = x_i \times x_j$$ where we ignore the repeats.


** Optimizing  the Weights with Gradient Descent
The goal is to have the predictions, $\hat{y}(X)$, be accurate. This is done by having, hopefully, lots of data,
$$\{ y^0, X^0\},\{y^1, X^1\}, \cdots,  \{y^{N-1}, X^{N-1}\}$$
which now includes the observed values of the parameter we hope to predict, $y$, to compare to.
We do this by minimizing the loss,
$$loss = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\left( y^i - \hat{y}(X^i) \right)^2$$,
where the only free parameters are the weights in $\hat{y}$.

/footnote:/ In a linear algebra context, we would consider the fully system as matrix multiplication, notionally written $$\bf{\hat{y}} = \textbf{X}\textbf{w}$$, and be concerned whether it was over/under determined and how to /regularize/. In these notes we expect that the system is over determined (there are more data examples than features).

In the machine learning context, we calculate the gradient of the loss w.r.t. the weights, $\nabla loss$, and take a /step/ in that direction by updating the weights with
$$w^{new} = w^{old} + n \nabla loss$$
where $n$ is a scalar called the *learning rate*.

This is done iteratively, either a number of iteration or until the loss reaches a desired threshold. It must be said that this scheme is a _local_ minimum finder; it will find a local minimum, but this is necessarily the lowest possible cost, also that the local minimum depends greatly on the starting set of weights.

** Choice of Loss function
It should be obvious that the choice of loss function greatly dictates the optimized weights. This is often stated as the crux of machine learning. At this point, we will only point out how it plays out the example of Linear Regression via  a small generalization of our previous loss function,

$$loss(m) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( | y^i - \hat{y}(X^i) | \right)^m$$

where the larger the value of $m$, the more large outliers in prediction error $$\left(|y - \hat{y}|\right)$$ contribute to the loss and, thus, the higher their priority for minimization during the optimization.

** Examples in PyTorch
- The following section shows PyTorch's use of Gradient Descent to fit a line to noisy data set.
- The standard linear regression naming conventions are used:  the input data $x$ and $y$, the fit parameter $w$ and bias $b$, and the predicted dependent value,
  $$\hat{y} = w x +b.$$
- Each regression is found using the *mean squared error* (MSE) cost function,
  $$loss =  \frac{1}{N} \sum (  y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2.$$
- Each epoch moves the parameters such that the MSE($\hat{y},y)$ is minimized.
  - Note:  epoch 0 line in each figure displays the initial values of the parameters.
*** Simple Gradient Descent
[[./LR_noDatasetClass.py][Example script]] using PyTorch for partial derivatives within a simple  linear regression on a  data set with normal noise added. This serves as the first step in using PyTorch as it does not employ any of the other PyTorch features which are the subject of the following examples.

Simple gradient the via PyTorch's partial derivative.
#+begin_src python  :results output
  # tells the tree to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss wrt all of the
  #contributing tensors with the "requires_grad = True" in their constructor.
  loss.backward()

  #gradient descent
  w.data = w.data - lr*w.grad.data
  b.data = b.data - lr*b.grad.data

  #must zero out the gradient otherwise PyTorch accumulates the gradient.
  w.grad.data.zero_()
  b.grad.data.zero_()
#+end_src

[[./figs/LR_noDatasetClass.png]]

**** Comments
- The optimal learning rate is directly connect to how good the initial guess is and how noisy the data is.
    - If there is a very large loss (error) and a moderate learning rate, the step is possibly too large, leading to an even larger loss and thus an even larger step, etc, until the loss is NA.
- With a single learning rate, the slope learned much faster than the bias.

*** Mini-Batch Gradient Descent using Dataset and DataLoader
[[./LR_miniBatch_datasetDataLoader.py][Example script]] using mini-batch gradient descent for linear regression, while also using PyTorch's Dataset and DataLoader features.
#+begin_src python  :results output
class noisyLineData(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, N=100, slope=3, intercept=2, stdDev=100):
        self.x = torch.linspace(-100,100,N)
        self.y = slope*self.x + intercept + np.random.normal(0, stdDev, N) #can use numpy for random

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.x[index], self.y[index]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.x)

data = noisyLineData()

trainloader = DataLoader(dataset = data, batch_size = 20)
#+end_src

[[./figs/LR_miniBatch_datasetDataLoader.png]]

**** Comments
- The *Dataset* and *DataLoader* concepts are simple and useful for abstracting out the data.
    - They will be particularly useful when the data is larger we can hold in the machine's memory.
- With the same learning rates as for the full gradient descent, the mini-batch often learned considerably faster than simple Gradient Descent per epoch.

*** Mini-Batch Gradient Descent the full PyTorch Way
[[./LR_miniBatch_PyTorchWay.py][Example script]] of the same linear regression scenario, now using =nn.modules= for the model and the =optim= for optimization (the step):
#+begin_src python  :results output
class linear_regression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        #call the super's constructor and use it without having to store it directly.
        super(linear_regression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        """Prediction"""
        return self.linear(x)

criterion = nn.MSELoss()

model = linear_regression(1,1)
model.state_dict()['linear.weight'][0] = 0
model.state_dict()['linear.bias'][0] = 0

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr = 1e-4)
#+end_src

[[./figs/LR_miniBatch_PyTorchway.png]]

*** Comments
- The optimizer =optim.SGD= easily beats mini-batch easily per-epoch.

* Logistic Regression for Linear Classification
- We map the out put of a line/plane to [0,1] for classification. To do this, we use the sigmoid function,
$$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}},$$
as the simple binary function flattens the gradient and thus leads to slow learning.

-  As a prediction we use,
$$ \hat{y}= 1 \text{ if } \sigma(x) >0.5 \text{ else }\hat{y} =0.$$

- We then use new loss to reflect the predictions, *Binary Cross Entropy Loss*.

** Example: Logistic Regression in 1D
[[./LogReg_PyTorch.py][Example script]]
Now we use linear regression and with the sigmoid function to find the line/plane/hyperplane between two classes, here [0,1].

#+begin_src python  :results output
#create noisy data
class NoisyBinaryData(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, N=100, x0=-3, x1=5, stdDev=2):
        xlist = []; ylist = []
        for i in range(N):
            #class 0
            if np.random.rand()<0.5:
                xlist.append(np.random.normal(x0,stdDev))
                ylist.append(0.0)
            #class 1
            else:
                xlist.append(np.random.normal(x1,stdDev))
                ylist.append(1.0)

        self.x = torch.tensor(xlist).view(-1,1)
        self.y = torch.tensor(ylist).view(-1,1)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.x[index], self.y[index]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.x)

np.random.seed(0)
data = NoisyBinaryData()
trainloader = DataLoader(dataset = data, batch_size = 20)

# create my "own" linear regression model
class logistic_regression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        #call the super's constructor and use it without having to store it directly.
        super(logistic_regression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        """Prediction"""
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear(x))

#+end_src

*** Loss
The loss is changed so we seperate the data, not fit the data each epoch
I first used the Cross entropy loss, but had a problem with NANs.
#+begin_src python  :results output
def criterion(yhat,y):
    out = -1 * torch.mean(y * torch.log(yhat) + (1 - y) * torch.log(1 - yhat))
    return out
#+end_src

PyTorch's BCELoss fixes this issue by setting $log(0) = -\infty$. See the [[https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html][BCELoss documentation]].
#+begin_src python  :results output
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
#+end_src


[[./figs/LogReg_PyTorch.png]]

*** Comments
- line does not simply separate the data as y = 0.5 would do that and not give any prediction power.

* Neural Network
** Softmax Classifier
- Used to linearly classify between two or more classes.

- Softmax Equation:
$$S(y_i) = \frac{exp(y_i)}{\sum exp(y_j)}$$
  - where, notably, $S(y_i) \in [0,1]$ and $\sum S(y_i) = 1$

- Softmax relies on the classic =argmax= programming function, $$\hat{y} = argmax_i(S(y_i))$$

- Softmax uses parameter vectors where the dot product is used to classify.

- The complicated part here is the *loss*. How to incentivize this behavior with a decent gradient for learning.

**** Softmax in PyTorch
Example: [[./softMax_linLayer_makemore.md]], which can be opened in python via the file with the .py extension or converted to a Jupyter Notebook by executing:

#+begin_src shell
jupytext softMax_linLayer_makemore.py -o softMax_linLayer_makemore.ipynb
#+end_src

As a side note, the Markdown is created with the following:
#+begin_src shell
jupytext softMax_linLayer_makemore.py -o softMax_linLayer_makemore.md
#+end_src

Excerpt:
#+begin_src python  :results output
epochs = 10000 # decrease if not using a GPU! Takes about 1min with an rtx 4 series

for i in range(epochs):
    # Learning rate decreases from lr_start-> lr_end over epochs
    # It is generally a good idea to reduce the learning rate like this
    lr_start, lr_end = 100, 10
    lr = lr_start - (lr_start-lr_end)*i/epochs

    logit = xenc @ W # log counts
    counts = logit.exp()
    probs = counts/counts.sum(1,keepdim=True)

    """
    Kaparthy's Loss: log of the probabilities of correct pediction, log, negate, mean
    This drives the exact element we want be 1 nearer to it.
    - works much better than niave loss function
    """
    loss = -probs[torch.arange(num),ys].log().mean()

    print(f'epoch: {i:04d},  lr: {lr:.3e}, loss: {loss}')

    W.grad = None
    loss.backward()

    W.data += -lr*W.grad
    W.grad.data.zero_()
#+end_src

***** Training
- When =loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()=, PyTorch will automatically use Softmax classification.
- The cod for training is identical to Linear Regression training-- ignoring data manipulation.

***** Validation
=argmax= is used to classify the output from the model
#+begin_src python  :results output
  for x_validation, y_validation in validation_loader:
    z = model(x_test)
    _,yhat = torch.max(z.data,1)
    correct = correct + ( yhat == y_test ).sum().item()

  accuracy = correct/N_validation
  accuracy_list.append(accuracy)
#+end_src

* Deep Neural Network

* Convolutional Neural Network

* Notes

** argmax example:
- Find three functions, on for each class, where the function that corresponds to each class has the largest value in the region where the class resides.
  - Then =argmax= is used to retrieve the class designation.

- $z0 = - x$,  $z1 = 1$, and $z2 = x -1$ and $f(x) = [z0(x), z1(x), z2(x)]$,
  - class 0 for $x \in (-\infty, -1)$
  - class 1 for $x \in (-1, 2)$
 - class 2 for $x \in (2, \infty)$

    |       | z0 | z1 | z2 | $\hat{y}$ |
    | arg   |  0 |  1 |  2 |  argmax   |
    |-------+----+----+----+-----------|
    | f(-5) | 10 |  1 | -6 |         0 |
    | f(1)  | -1 |  1 |  0 |         1 |
    | f(4)  | -4 |  1 |  3 |         2 |
